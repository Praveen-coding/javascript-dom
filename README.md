This is a repo when i learning DOM. So, I want to share it.

### Q- What is DOM ?
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in the memory. The DOM is a object Model (the DOM tree) is made of objects.
Each object represents different part of the page located in the browser window.
It makes by using four types of node:
- Document Node
- Element Node
- Attribute Node
- Text Node
